# 🚢 Titanic Survival Classifier

Predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning classification techniques! 🧑‍💻💡

## What’s Inside? 📦

- `titanic.ipynb` — Complete notebook with data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and predictions.  
- `train.csv` — Training data with passenger details and survival labels.  
- `test.csv` — Test data for which survival predictions are made.  
- `submission.csv` — Output file containing predicted survival statuses.  

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter or Kaggle environment.  
2. Run all cells to replicate the entire workflow, from raw data to final predictions.  
3. No external configs or dependencies required beyond standard Python ML libraries.

## Key Features ✨

- Binary classification task: survived (1) or not (0).  
- Includes feature engineering like handling missing values, encoding, and scaling.  
- Model evaluation and validation using standard metrics.  

## Notes 📝

- Data sourced from Kaggle Titanic competition.  
- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets with no missing values remaining.  
- Perfect for learning classification pipelines and Kaggle workflow basics!
